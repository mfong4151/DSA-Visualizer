It allows users to see how data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more work, and how different algorithms such as sorting, searching, and pathfinding are implemented. The application also provides a platform for users to practice and improve their understanding of these concepts. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive functionality, the DSA Visualizer is a valuable tool for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning more about data structures and algorithms.</div>;
