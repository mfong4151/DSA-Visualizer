export const descBFS: string[] = ["Breadth-First Search (BFS): This is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level. It is often implemented using a queue data structure, and is useful for solving problems such as finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph and detecting whether a graph is bipartite."]
